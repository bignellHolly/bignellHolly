Hi there! I'm Holly Bignell, a chemistry grad with a passion for genomic data science. Currently traveling through Australia, I'm also diving into game development with C# and Unity. I love unraveling the mysteries of data, from atmospheric emissions to RNA expression in lymphoma cells. Ready to kickstart my career in a data-driven role, I'm excited to turn complex data into actionable insights. Let's connect and explore together!
